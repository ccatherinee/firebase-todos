Svelte is a lot different from the "major" frameworks like React because while Reach does the bulk of the work in-browser, Svelte does that same work in a compile step which happens at build-time. Furthermore, Svelte is a lot "simpler" than React. For example, in Svelte we can set variable with "let x = 1" whereas in React we would do "const [a, setA] = useState(1)". Svelte components are also exported by default (which makes it easier for the developer). All in all, although Svelte and React have the same functionalities, it seems like Svelte is more developer friendly.
